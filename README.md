# StubLab


StubLab is an innovative stub server application designed to empower development teams to configure, test, and iterate on APIs quickly—without relying on a traditional database. It provides a robust platform for developers to streamline their API workflows, making the process of building and testing APIs more efficient and hassle-free.  

Built for organizations aiming to enhance their API development processes, StubLab enables users to define reusable models for API requests and responses. Developers can instantly generate mock data and share configurations across teams, fostering collaboration and ensuring consistency in API behavior throughout the development lifecycle.  

With built-in Swagger support, StubLab simplifies the creation and documentation of API specifications. Teams can generate comprehensive API documentation automatically, making integration with frontend systems and external collaborators seamless and straightforward.  

## Key Features

  - Operates independently of a traditional database, enabling quick setup and streamlined workflows.
  - Users can define and reuse models, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency across APIs.
  - Automatically generates realistic mock data for testing various API scenarios.
  - Built-in Swagger support simplifies generating, visualizing, and documenting API specifications.
  - Share configurations and API setups across development teams, fostering collaborative workflows.
  - Simplifies collaboration between backend, frontend, and external teams by providing a unified API documentation and testing environment.

## Error Simulation
  Simulate error scenarios like timeouts, invalid responses, or specific HTTP error codes for robust API testing.


# Getting Started with StubLab

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
